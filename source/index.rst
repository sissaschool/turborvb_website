Features
########################

`TurboRVB <https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0005037>`__ is a computational package for **ab initio Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations** of both molecular and bulk electronic systems. 
The code was initially launched by **Prof. Sandro Sorella** and **Prof. Michele Casula** and has been continuously developed by many contributors for over 20 years. The code implements two types of well established QMC algorithms: Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), and Diffusion Monte Carlo in its robust and efficient lattice regularized variant (LRDMC).

The source codes of TurboRVB and other associated packages are available from :doc:`_sources/03Source_code`.

TurboRVB is distinguishable from other QMC codes in the following features:

- The code employs a resonating valence bond (RVB)-type wave function, such as the Jastrow Geminal/Jastrow Pfaffian. This wave function includes the correlation effect beyond the Jastrow-Slater wave function, which is commonly used in other QMC codes.

- Implemented state-of-art optimization algorithms, such as the stochastic reconfiguration and the linear method, realize a stable optimization of the amplitude and nodal surface of many-body wave functions at the variational quantum Monte Carlo level.

- The code implements the so-called lattice regularized diffusion Monte Carlo method, which provides a numerically stable diffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculation.
  
- The implementation of an adjoint algorithmic differentiation allows us to differentiate many-body wave functions efficiently and to perform structural optimizations and calculate molecular dynamics.
